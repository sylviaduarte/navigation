First HTML+CSS project. Interactive front page

Hello! This is my first serious "programming" project. This is a redo of my family's clinic site.

Originally, in order to get a comprehensive grasp on the potential of HTML and CSS (specifically flexbox),
I was only going to restylize the existing text from the original page, but I got a bit ahead of myself....
  
This is my attempt to create an interactive business website with purely HTML and CSS. 
There are likely better solutions for creating interactive elements on a webpage that can be found with JavaScript,
but I wanted to see what was possible with the languages I knew already. 

UPDATE:
Navigation.v3 is my attempt to make the existing site mobile-friendly (and generally learn about responsive web design).
